                    Hi, my name is Dmitry and I am from Yoshkar-Ola and I am a website developer. I am 17 years old and I am just starting my way in IT. This site is made completely about me and here you can learn a little more about me and my skillsðŸ™‚ At the moment I am studying in the college, but unfortunately not in my specialty, in the future I will try to change the faculty I need.

                    My path in IT began with courses on programming in iSpring, namely learning JavaScript and writing my first game in this language. After the first course I decided to try something new and found the perfect option for myself in the form of web development. I was given to me at first all very difficult, but later I was able to make a project for the defense and even work with a real clientðŸ™‚
